  <h2>1. Prana Mudra</h2>
  <p>As the name suggests this mudra helps to stabilize the airflow and energy (or the prana) in the body and practicing this regularly helps to activate and energize each cell of your body.

It balances the biochemical and physiological processes and induces youthfulness and cheerfulness. Moreover, it is the mudra of life and plays an important role in improving the confidence of a weaker individual. This mudra deals with the balancing of Jal, Prithvi, and Agni.</p><br><p>Method: The thumb, ring, and little finger are kept in contact with each other, and the remaining fingers are outstretched. Slowly taking in a deep breath and expiring out air, with eyes closed and hands placed either horizontally or vertically, feel the energy flowing in your body.</p>

  <h2>3. Dhyana Mudra</h2>
  <p>As the name of this mudra suggests, it is very effective in bringing peace and harmony to the mind. In a state of chaos, stress, and tension, it is clear fact that one cannot meditate; therefore, this mudra brings you to a calm state in a short time so you can have a blank, clear, and calm mind for the meditation.

This mudra helps to balance all the Pancha tattvas. Similarly, I am pretty sure that you have seen this posture in the photographs of many sadhus or seen the idols of Lord Buddha in this mudra!
</p><p>
Method: Sit comfortably and easily in ‘Sukhaasan’ (spine erect and crossed legs). Put the right hand (palm) over the left palm and join the thumb. Now gently close your eyes and breathe slowly and deeply keeping both palm in your lap. You will feel calm and relaxed in no time.</p><br>

  <h2>4. Varuna Mudra</h2>
  <p>This mudra is very helpful for those who are suffering from liver disease or any blood-related disorders. As this mudra balances the Jal and Agni of the Pancha tattva, any joint-related disorder which is caused due to lack of Jal tattva is also taken care of by this mudra.
<p></p>Method: Bring the tip of the thumb and little finger near one another, and keep this position of the hand for at least a day for as long as you prefer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h2>5. Surya Mudra
</h2>
  <p>Surya means the sun or the symbol of great energy and activeness. At times, everyone feels tired and lethargic for no reason, and this feeling of fatigue can be balanced with the help of this mudra.</p>
<p>Surya Mudra also helps to maintain harmony between the Agni and Prithvi tattva. Some specialists in mudra say that practicing this mudra regularly can invoke the hidden supernormal power in the human psyche.</p><p>Method: The ring finger is bent and the tip of the thumb is allowed to touch the middle portion of the ring finger. Similarly, the ring finger is made to touch the root of the thumb. You can also take deep breathes during the process.</p><br><br><br><br>

  <h2>6. Ling Mudra</h2>
  <p>For those people who have respiratory problems like COPD, asthma, and frequent cough and cold, this mudra can do wonders as it helps to maintain a balance between the Agni and the Jal tattva in the body.

Especially during a cold, people are more prone to get respiratory-related problems including irritating runny nose, and dry or productive cough. These symptoms appear because the fire tattva of the body is less and Jal tattva is more; therefore, practicing this mudra can work wonders for sure.</p><p>Method: The palms of both hands are kept in contact with each other and interlocked together. Additionally, the left thumb is raised and the right thumb and index encircle it. This mudra needs to be done for 30 to 50 minutes daily and the results are sure to be good.</p>

Joint pain, arthritis, and even rheumatoid arthritis can be taken as a good examples of such imbalance. Similarly, toothache, stomachache, and also headaches are other problems related to Vayu which can disturb the well-being of our day-to-day life. Therefore, Vayu mudra helps to maintain all these problems and balance between the Jal and the Agni tattva</p><p>Method: The index finger must be folded and kept at the root of the thumb, while the thumb should touch the middle portion of the index finger. Similar to other mudras, deep breathing with this mudra can also be very helpful.</p><br><br><br>
